        Hi! My name is Robert Moore. I grew up in Chapel Hill, NC, and I presently live in RTP/Durham, NC. </p>

        <p>During high school I had an education focusing more on classic latin and history. While in school I excelled in chemistry and math, and ended up going to NC State University in Raleigh studying chemical engineering. 
            </p>
           <p> My career as of yet has spanned through polymer manufacturing and polymer research, as well as specialty materials R/D and QA. I'm excited to learn software to have a more full and rounded education with the capability to interact with computers in a meaningful way. 
            </p>
           <p> In my free time I enjoy bodybuilding, reading, cooking, and language learning. My best languages after English are Russian and Hungarian. I also like watching Canes hockey and No-limit Texas Hold'em.
